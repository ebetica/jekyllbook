Here's chapter 1 (translated to Chinese)!

Here is some math: $\mathcal{G} e^ix = \sin(x) + i \cos(x)$

Euler's identity $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ is a beautiful formula in $\mathbb{2}$.

Here's a more complicated formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{n+1} &= \frac{x_{n+1} + nc_n}{n+1} \\
\iff a_{n+1} &= a_n + \frac{x_{n+1} - a_n}{n+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

```python
import os

def fun():
    here = "is some code"
    fun()

# please don't run this code
```
